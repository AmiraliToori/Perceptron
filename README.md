# Perceptron
This is a Python implementation of the Perceptron algorithm. I wanted to write my own artificial neural network to gain an understanding of how they work and started with the simplest one. I make use of no external libraries and the code, although easy to understand, is not very efficient. It uses .txt files!

A Perceptron is used to define a hyperplane which divides the input space into two half-spaces and can be used to make binary classification.
